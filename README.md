Assorted Examples
=================

Various (small) projects I have done will be added to this stash. They don't really merit there own repos, but still are worth keeping around and orgranizing. 

Some older projects end up in here when I realize that they are pretty small, and are just noise to my bigger projects as repos. One of the exceptions to this is the connect4 ai, which started in here and then got a full repo (mainly because of go's opinions). (Also happend to the theorem prover)

Many of the projects could be saved as gists, but for some others its nice to have gh-pages for them.

Most of these projects are not well documented, but if something catches your eye and you'd like to know more, make an issue and I'll be happy to explain it to you.

The project in here that I am the most proud of is this [animated aperature science logo](http://thethirdone.github.io/assorted-examples/html/portal.html) made using only css and html (+font).
